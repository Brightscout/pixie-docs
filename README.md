## ðŸš€ Quickstart for contributors

To run in development mode, run the following commands:
```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000/` to view the app.

To generate a production build, run:
```shell
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Updating content
To pull updated content, run:
```shell
./update_docs.sh
```
This will overwrite `external/pxl_documentation.json`.
Add the changed file to the repo, and submit a pull request.

## Notes
- For nesting documents in the left sidebar, create a folder with the same name as the top level `.md` filename.
  Nested navigation is generated automatically, and is alphabetically ordered.
  At this time, only one level of nesting is supported.

## Live Code Editor

To render react components for live editing in Markdown content, add `react-live=true` after a code block's language specifier. For example:
````markdown
```javascript react-live=true
<button>Edit my text</button>
```
````
This is achieved using the [`react-live` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-live).

## ðŸ¤– SEO friendly

This is a static site and comes with all the SEO benefits thereof.
Using [MDX Frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/writing-pages/), you can set search-engine-friendly metadata for each page.

A basic page might set its title, as well as the title and description that search engines see, by placing this at the top of its file:
```markdown
---
title: "Title of the page"
metaTitle: "Meta Title Tag for this page"
metaDescription: "Meta Description Tag for this page"
---
```

Canonical URLs are generated automatically.
