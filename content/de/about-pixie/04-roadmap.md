## Vision

Our vision is to build a product that enables software developers to engineer the systems of the future. To start we are:

- **Eliminating grunt work**: to improve developer efficiency and happiness by building an observability platform that eliminates the work required to monitor your applications. 

- **Building a product for developers by developers**. At Pixie itâ€™s our goal to make solving easy problems easy, and solving hard problems possible. With that in mind we strive to be useful out of the box, but allow for easy extensibility through an open API and Python based programming language.

- **Building a community**: Pixie Community is free forever. By making the majority of our product free for individuals to use, as well as open sourcing all of our scripts, we hope to build a community knowledge base of data-driven tools to observe, debug and manage applications. 


## Guiding Principles

- **Store useful data only**: Developers waste far too much time and money building centralized data systems to truck around telemetry which is mostly useless. Moving data closer to the source and storing only useful live data with summarized historicals allows us to enable edge-ML on unsampled data, scale faster and fundamentally change the unit-economics of telemetry systems.

- **Auto-collect baseline data**: Months of engineering time are in adding language specific instrumentation across codebases in order to get visibility. Pixie avoids this by collecting baseline metrics, traces, logs and events without code changes while exposing tooling to ingest custom last-mile telemetry as needed.

- **Programmatic data access**: Exploration, debugging, and analysis workflows typically require manual configuration and navigation through siloed GUIs. Pixie exposes a unified data layer, and analysis signals via an expressive API which enables efficient developer workflows and frees up data to build powerful integrations.


## Roadmap

In lieu of our move to [open source Pixie](https://blog.pixielabs.ai/pixie-new-relic/), we will be publishing an updated roadmap soon.
